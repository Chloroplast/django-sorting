# django-sorting

This is a simple Django web app that sorts a list of integers using various sorting algorithms.

## Goals:
- Learn the fundamentals of Django
  - Model, Template, View Pattern
  - Testing
- Improve Python ability
- Learn common sorting algorithms
  - This goal will be to try and recreate well-known sorting algorithms by reading about their implementation without looking at code. Initially targetting one algorithm a week.
  
## Antigoals:
- Focus on the UI - The UI should be functional, but as simple as possible while still facilitating Django learning
- Poor code quality - I should take my time to learn what high-quality Python code looks like, with a focus on SOLID principles
- Deploying the app - Running locally should be fine for learning
